# Instructions

Run the Colab file to build your Model [Remember to use GPU or TPU runtime for faster Execution].

You can even customise it if you want.

Download the model and copy in folder where you cloned this Repo.

Now open this folder in VS Code and in its terminal run Streamlit file [web.py].

Finally you can use individual images of dataset to test your model.



# Future Plans

Suggest actions to be taken on the Plant.

Split the dataset into train, dev and test.

Setup Backend TF Server using FastAPI.

Develop website using React.

Make a lighter model with help of Quantisation techniques which is required to make a Mobile App using React Native that shall be very helpful for the Farmers.

Finally, Deployment using Google Cloud Platform [GCP].
